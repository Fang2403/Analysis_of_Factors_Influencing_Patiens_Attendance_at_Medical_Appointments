### Project Overview

This project is dedicated to analyzing and predicting patient attendance at scheduled medical appointments. Utilizing a dataset sourced from 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments), the focus is on identifying key factors that influence whether patients miss their appointments. By understanding these determinants, healthcare providers can develop strategies to improve attendance rates, thus enhancing healthcare delivery and resource management.

### Dataset Description 

The dataset comprises various attributes that could potentially influence whether patients attend their scheduled medical appointments. These attributes include demographic information, health characteristics, appointment details, and socio-economic indicators among others.

**Data Dictionary**

* PatientId: Unique identifier for each patient.
  
* AppointmentID: Unique identifier for each appointment.
  
* Gender: Gender of the patient (M for male, F for female).
  
* ScheduledDay: The date and time when the appointment was scheduled.
  
* AppointmentDay: The date of the actual appointment.
  
* Age: Age of the patient.
  
* Neighbourhood: The neighborhood where the appointment is scheduled.
  
* Scholarship: Indicates whether the patient is enrolled in the Bolsa Fam√≠lia welfare program (0 for not enrolled, 1 for enrolled).
  
* Hipertension: Indicates whether the patient has hypertension (0 for no, 1 for yes).
  
* Diabetes: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (0 for no, 1 for yes).
  
* Alcoholism: Indicates whether the patient has alcoholism (0 for no, 1 for yes).
  
* Handicap: Indicates the level of handicap of the patient (0 for no handicap, 1-4 for varying degrees of handicap).
  
* SMS_received: Indicates whether the patient received an SMS reminder for the appointment (0 for no, 1 for yes).
  
*  No-show: Tells us if the patient did not show up to their appointment; "No" if they did show up, and "Yes" if they did not.

### Objective

The primary aim of this analysis is to identify significant predictors of patient no-shows and to build a predictive model that can forecast the likelihood of a patient missing their appointment. This insight will be crucial for healthcare practitioners and administrators aiming to devise effective interventions to reduce no-show rates.

### Expected Outcomes

Through detailed exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling, this project expects to:

1. Uncover the main reasons behind patient absence.
2. Provide recommendations on how to address these issues to improve appointment attendance.
3. Develop a reliable predictive model that can be used by healthcare facilities to anticipate and mitigate potential absence.
